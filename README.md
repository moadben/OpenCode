## Overview
OpenCode provides a hub for beginner programmers to meet, to collaborate, and get exposure to open source, while taking on an active role in software development and expressing ideas. By auto generating a docker file and forking the repo for environment setup, OpenCode provides an easy-to-do process with little chance of error, regarding environment setup, to eliminate the common barrier most face when contributing to open source.
